                Quitly is a app for you who is trying to overcome an addiction. Qutly lets you easily track the amount of time youve gone without the thing youre addicted to. Addiction is a brain disorder characterized by compulsive engagement in rewarding stimuli, despite adverse consequences.[8] Despite the involvement of a number of psychosocial factors, a biological process – one which is induced by repeated exposure to an addictive stimulus – is the core pathology that drives the development and maintenance of an addiction. </p>
